**Introduction and Purpose: Understand Docker’s role in modern development.**
- Docker is a platform that helps developers package applications and their dependencies into containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone unit that runs the same way in any environment—whether it’s your local machine, a test server, or a cloud platform.

**example**
-   Docker like a lunchbox for apps. 🍱
-   Docker your app and everything it needs (tools, settings, libraries) are packed inside a container—like putting all your food in a lunchbox.

 **Why use Docker?**
✅ Consistency Across Environments → Eliminates the "works on my machine" issue.

✅ Lightweight & Fast → Uses fewer resources compared to VMs.

✅ Easy Deployment & Scaling → Run multiple containers seamlessly.

✅ Microservices Ready → Perfect for breaking applications into independent services.

✅ Works with Kubernetes → Supports container orchestration for large-scale applications.
